# Spotting Fake Reviews
The reviews today are increasingly held in consideration by users when they have to make a decision. 
The companies that make the content give much importance, for instance, to their online reputation and to digital marketing. 
Basically before making a purchase the reviews of other users are examined to see if the seller is reliable. 
Together with the fake reviews, the problem of the truth of online information expands if we consider identity verification, market protection, brand management, malicious behavior and data journalism
